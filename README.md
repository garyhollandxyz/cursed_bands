`cursed bands` is a Twitter bot which tweets programatically generated band names.

Functions for generating several types of band name (such as `newAdjectiveNounName` and `newPrepositionAdjectiveNounName`) are defined and picked from based on a randomly generated number. The individual words making up the name are then picked from stored lists, also based on a randomly generated number.
